     *  **** Path Finding Algorithm by Sam ****
     *  
     *  Mark current block as seen
     * 
     *  if obstacles
     *     mark forward as obstacles
     *  
     *  find possible direction(s)
     *  for each direction
     *    if the next block is unseen
     *      choose that direction
     *      
     *  if no direction is chose
     *      choose one direction randomly
